### Phase 3: UI/UX Refinement (Days 11-15)

8. **Navigation System**

   1. Implement breadcrumb navigation for easy section traversal
   2. Create consistent back buttons for navigation between sections
   3. Ensure mobile-responsive navigation
9. **Responsive Design Implementation**

   1. Test and refine all components for mobile responsiveness
   2. Implement adaptive layouts for different screen sizes
   3. Ensure table-based plans are readable on all devices
10. **Accessibility Improvements**

    1. Add proper ARIA labels to all interactive elements
    2. Ensure keyboard navigation works throughout the application
    3. Test with screen readers and make necessary adjustments

### Phase 4: Data Management and Integration (Days 16-20)

11. **Job Posting Integration**

    1. Implement job posting URL display on role landing pages
    2. Create a system to extract and display job details from URLs
    3. Add job ID and location information to role pages
12. **Data Persistence**

    1. Implement local storage for saving user progress
    2. Create data export functionality for sharing career plans
    3. Implement data import functionality

### Phase 5: Testing and Refinement (Days 21-25)

13. **Comprehensive Testing**

    1. Create unit tests for core components
    2. Implement integration tests for role creation flow
    3. Perform end-to-end testing of the complete user journey
14. **Performance Optimization**

    1. Implement code splitting for faster initial load
    2. Optimize image loading and processing
    3. Reduce unnecessary re-renders
15. **Documentation**

    1. Update README with setup and usage instructions
    2. Create developer documentation for the component structure
    3. Document the standardized section approach

### Phase 6: Deployment and Monitoring (Days 26-30)

16. **Deployment Preparation**

    1. Set up production build process
    2. Configure environment variables for production
    3. Create deployment scripts
17. **Launch**

    1. Deploy to production environment
